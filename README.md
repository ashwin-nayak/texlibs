# Custom LateX libraries

A collection of a few latex formatting styles, color definitions and bib styles that I regularly use.

## Usage

Intended usage is to include this entire repo as a submodule in latex projects.

For a LaTeX project,

```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:ashwin-nayak/texlibs.git
```
